        <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Inevitable Pain</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>The whitepaper 'The Inevitable Pain of Software Development, Including of Extreme Programming, Caused by Requirements Volatility' echoed a common theme that we have discussed in class, software is hard. The paper describes the evolution of the software development system, highlighting the flaws in each along the way. The authors main argument is that changing software requirements make it difficult (painful) for the software developer and that no system exists that alleviates all the pain. There is a need for a system which deals with ever changing requirements of software.</p>

      <div class="contentTitle"><h1>DevOps Article</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>DevOps is a model of company culture and development practice. It is characterized by collaboration across all levels of a company, rapid deployment of software, and continuous improvement. DevOps was created to bridge the gap between software developers and IT operations. DevOps encourages developers and IT to collaborate so that systems remain stable with rapid deployment of new technology.</p>
          <p>To accomplish the goals of DevOps, three main   techniques are used: automation, continuous testing, and continuous deployment. Automation is accomplished by using automated tools and utilities that are either developed ‘in house’ or sourced from elsewhere. continuous testing is a quality by design model, where QA engages with a project from the inception, rather than after all the code is written. Continuous deployment is the rapid deployment of new features or improvements. Continuous deployment requires that new features are delivered tested and secure.

      <div class="contentTitle"><h1>Code Reads #12: Big Ball of Mud</h1></div>
        <div class="contentText">
          <p>I found that the article summarized a very important lesson, put something out that works and worry about form later (or only as necessary). Often in business, first to the market is more advantageous than being the best. Once you put out a working system, then with feedback of users, you can iteratively add improvements as necessary. The main disadvantage to this approach seems to be that maintenance is difficult. I would also think keeping software designed as a ball of mud running would be difficult if the people who created it left the organization with little warning.</p>
